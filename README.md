Lost in Localization
====================

This is a showcase repository to talk about advanced localization in Symfony2, using [L10nBundle](https://github.com/lafourchette/L10nBundle) by [LaFourchette](http://www.lafourchette.com/).

Provisioning is made with [https://github.com/fansible/DevopsBundle](https://github.com/fansible/DevopsBundle).
Just follow their instructions to install the project on your machine, you may need some tweaking for the Apache configuration.
In case you need more info, check [Symfony documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/configuration/web_server_configuration.html).

If you don't care about provisioning, just launch `composer install` and you're good to go.
